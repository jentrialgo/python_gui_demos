# Framework-name

This directory is a template for creating new directories for frameworks.

For creating a new framework, run this command from the root directory of the
repository changing `new_framework` with the name of the new framework:

```bash
cp -r framework_template demos/new_framework
```

Then, change this README, that should describe the new framework.
