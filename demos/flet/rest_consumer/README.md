# REST consumer

This directory shows how to create and build an application that consumes a REST
service and shows the results in a list.

Install flet with:

```bash
pip install flet
```

Run the application as a desktop app with:

```bash
python rest_consumer.py
```

If you want to run it as a web app, use this command:

```bash
flet --web rest_consumer.py
```
