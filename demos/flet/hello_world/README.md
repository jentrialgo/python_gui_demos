# Hello, world!

This directory shows how to create and build a "Hello, world!" application,
basically the minimum possible application with only a label saying "Hello,
world!".

Install flet with:

```bash
pip install flet
```

Run the application as a desktop app with:

```bash
python hello.py
```

If you want to run it as a web app, use this command:

```bash
flet --web hello.py
```
